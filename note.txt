from observation from method and the result of MGOGAN vs MIM GANs 
Tames suggest 
since mim gan each generator learn from different aspect of data (totally and disconnect)
so mim gan is more suitable for mnist dataset which data in different class can totally distinct from each other 
but MGOGAN that use only orthogonal vector to maximize distant between each generator can generate intemidiat information
MGO GAN might more suitable for our work since voice data distribution is continuous not discrete
